## 🚀 Overview

SimulEx is an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" simulation platform that combines real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty, OCR-enabled asset submission, and real-time analytics. Our platform bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, offering both training and assessment capabilities in one solution.

## 🎯 Problem

Traditional corporate training and hiring processes suffer from:

- **Wrong Hires, Wasted Money**: Companies keep hiring the wrong people—time, salary, and training costs wasted.
- **Fake Skills, No Real Test**: Many hires pass interviews but fail on the job with no hands-on environment to prove skills.
- **Slow, Inefficient Hiring Process**: Too many rounds, test sheets, and guesswork with no live data or real output.
- **No KPI or Proof of Skill**: Current systems don't track real performance with no real-time KPIs or session recordings.

## 💡 Solution

SimulEx places users in a 2.5D office environment with stations for various roles:

- **Developer Bay**: Real terminal challenges and coding tasks
- **Design Lab**: Creative briefs and asset submission
- **Project Management Hub**: Decision-making and resource allocation
- **Data Entry Station**: Accuracy and speed challenges
- **AI Engineering Zone**: Prompt engineering and model evaluation

Each station features authentic tools and tasks that mirror real-world workflows, with AI-powered adaptivity and comprehensive analytics.
